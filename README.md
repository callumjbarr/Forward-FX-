# Forward-FX-

Forward FX Using Interest Rate Parity:

I explored the Interest Rate Parity (IRP) theorem through a practical, automated example. Using Python, I collected interest rate data from FRED and the RBNZ B2 series, covering maturities of 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year, alongside the current spot FX rate. I then applied IRP to calculate forward exchange rates based on the interest rate differential between New Zealand and the U.S.
For one forward rate, I performed a sensitivity analysis in Excel to show how it could change in a given month depending on movements in interest rates in both countries.
